      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          <span>Var:</span> Variables declared with the var keyword are either
          globally scoped or function scoped. If a variable is declared with var
          outside of a function, it is globally scoped and can be accessed from
          anywhere in the code. If a variable is declared with var inside a
          function, it is function scoped and can only be accessed within that
          function1.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>let:</span> Variables declared with the let keyword are block
          scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing
          block (e.g., an if statement or for loop). This means that if you
          declare a variable with let inside a block, it cannot be accessed
          outside of that block2.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>const:</span>
          Like let, variables declared with the const keyword are also block
          scoped. However, unlike let, variables declared with const cannot be
          reassigned after they are declared2.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          <span>undefined:</span> A variable that has been declared but has not
          yet been assigned a value will have the value undefined1. For example,
          if you declare a variable with let myVar;, then myVar will be
          undefined until you assign it a value. Additionally, if you try to
          access an object property or array element that does not exist, the
          value returned will be undefined.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>null:</span> In contrast to undefined, null is typically used
          when you want to explicitly set a variable to have no value1. For
          example, if you have a variable that is meant to hold an object
          reference, you might initialize it to null to indicate that it does
          not currently reference any object. This can be useful when checking
          if a variable has been assigned a value or not.
        </p>

      <h2>What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface) is a type of API that follows the REST architectural style.
        REST is a set of constraints that define how applications or devices can
        connect to and communicate with each other1. REST APIs are sometimes
        referred to as RESTful APIs1. REST APIs provide a flexible and
        lightweight way to integrate applications and connect components in
        microservices architectures1. They can be developed using virtually any
        programming language and support a variety of data formats1. The only
        requirement is that they align with the six REST design principles, also
        known as architectural constraints: Uniform interface, Client-server
        decoupling, Statelessness, Cacheability, Layered system architecture,
        and Code on demand (optional)1. In summary, a REST API is an API that
        conforms to the design principles of the REST architectural style and
        allows for interaction with RESTful web services2. It provides a way for
        applications to communicate with each other in a flexible and
        lightweight manner.
